        On small file systems, the “Block Bitmap” is normally located at the
        first block, or second block if a superblock backup is present, of each
        block group. Its official location can be determined by reading the “
        <a href="/ext2/block-group-descriptor">bg_block_bitmap</a>” in its
        associated <a href="/ext2/block-group-descriptor">group descriptor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each bit represent the current state of a block within that block group,
        where 1 means “used” and 0 “free/available”. The first block of this
        block group is represented by bit 0 of byte 0, the second by bit 1 of
        byte 0. The 8th block is represented by bit 7 (most significant bit) of
        byte 0 while the 9th block is represented by bit 0 (least significant
        bit) of byte 1.
