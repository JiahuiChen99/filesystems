          any value greater than or equal to 1 is perfectly valid, many software
          programs and a few operating systems’ FAT file system drivers may not
          function properly if the value is something other than 2. All

          The reason the standard value for this field is 2 is to provide redun-

          of the FATs, that data is not lost because it is duplicated in the
          other FAT. On non-disk-based media, such as FLASH memory cards, where
          such redundancy is a useless feature, a value of 1 may be used to save
          the space that a second copy of the FAT uses, but some FAT file system
          drivers might not recognize such a volume properly.
