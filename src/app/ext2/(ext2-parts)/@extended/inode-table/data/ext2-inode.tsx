          is a block containing an array of block ID containing the data.
          Therefore, the 13th block of the file will be the first block ID
          contained in the indirect block. With a 1KiB block size, blocks 13 to

          doubly-indirect block; which is a block containing an array of
          indirect block IDs, with each of those indirect blocks containing an
          array of blocks containing the data. In a 1KiB block size, there would
          be 256 indirect blocks per doubly-indirect block, with 256 direct
          blocks per indirect block for a total of 65536 blocks per
          doubly-indirect block.

        <p>
          The 15th entry in this array is the block number of the
          triply-indirect block; which is a block containing an array of
          doubly-indrect block IDs, with each of those doubly-indrect block
          containing an array of indrect block, and each of those indirect block
          containing an array of direct block. In a 1KiB file system, this would
